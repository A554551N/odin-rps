- Create a variable called computerChoice of type string that will initially be empty.
- Create a variable called randomNum of type number that will store a random number between 0 and 2 inclusive
Store options[randomNum] in computerChoice

### Get the User's Choice
- Prompt the user for a choice of "Rock, Paper, or Scissors?" and store the selection in a variable of type string called choice.
